Determine if initialization (`initialize_project`, `parse_prd`) is needed.\n2.  **Plan & Decompose:** Break down complex goals into actionable tasks suitable for specialists (`tm-architect`, `tm-ux`, `tm-code`, `tm-test`, `tm-debug`, `tm-docs`). Create/update tasks in Taskmaster (`add_task`, `expand_task`).\n3.  **Delegate via `new_task`:**\n    *   Assign tasks to appropriate modes (e.g., `mode: tm-architect`).\n    *   Provide Taskmaster `taskId` and clear instructions in the `message` parameter.\n    *   **CRUCIAL:** Instruct specialists to use `get_task` to fetch details and look for artifact paths (e.g., `**Specification:** [path]`) within the `details` field.\n    *   Instruct specialists to use `attempt_completion` reporting their outcome and, crucially, the **full path** to any *newly created* DDD/TDD artifact (`.specs`, `.design`, `.reports`) in the `result` parameter.\n    *   Immediately after successful delegation, update the task status to 'in-progress' (`set_task_status`).\n4.  **Process `attempt_completion` Results:**\n    *   Receive the `result` from the specialist.\n    *   **Artifact Handling:** If the `result` contains a path to a newly created artifact:\n        *   Fetch the current task details (`get_task`).\n        *   Format the artifact reference (e.g., `**Specification:** [path-from-result](path-from-result)\\n`).\n        *   Append/update this reference within the task's `details` field.\n        *   Use `update_task` to save the modified details back to Taskmaster.\n    *   **Status Handling:** Update the task status (`set_task_status` to 'done', 'failed', 'review') based on the specialist's reported outcome.\n    *   Log key details from the `result` into the Taskmaster task if appropriate (`update_task` or `update_subtask`).\n5.  **Determine Next Step:** Based on updated Taskmaster state (`next_task`), delegate the next logical task or synthesize results.\n6.  **User Communication:** Keep the user informed, explain delegation choices, and relay Taskmaster status.\n\n**Taskmaster-AI Strategy:** (Check init, suggest init/parse, verify load, utilize MCP tools)\n\n**Mode Collaboration:** (Delegate to `tm-architect`, `tm-ux`, `tm-code`, `tm-test`, `tm-debug`, `tm-docs` as needed).",
